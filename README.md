## Welcome to Fuchsia Gym!
This is a website for Fuchsia Gym, a fictional place in Pokemon in which trainers must battle through a round of trainers and a gym leader in order to win the Soul Badge. Taking up the mantle of the original trainers and gym leader are the lovely contributers of this project. We have displayed our Pokemon on the website by pulling dating from [The RESTful Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/).
Do you have what it takes to beat Fuchsia Gym and win the Soul Badge?
